# Prototyping with Fresh: A Guide for PMs and Designers

This guide gets you from zero to a working prototype using the Fresh Design System.
No backend knowledge required.

## Fastest Way: Use an AI Coding Agent

If you use Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or a similar AI coding tool, you can skip
the manual setup entirely. Paste a prompt like this:

> Clone the Fresh Design System repo (zarni-fresh/fresh-design-system-v2), create
> a branch called prototype/[feature-name], and run the blank starter on web.
> I want to build a [describe your screen].

The agent will handle git, npm, and terminal commands for you. You focus on
describing what you want.

Here are some example prompts to get started:

**Starting a new prototype:**

> Clone fresh-design-system-v2, create a branch called prototype/patient-intake,
> install dependencies, and run the blank starter on web. Then build me a patient
> intake form with fields for name, date of birth, email, and phone number. Use
> a PageHeader, Card with TextFields, and a StickyActionFooter with a Save button.

**Iterating on an existing prototype:**

> Switch to my prototype/patient-intake branch. Add a second screen that shows a
> summary of the entered data using a SummaryCard. Add a back button to the
> PageHeader.

**Exploring what is available:**

> Read the component status doc and the icon catalog in the Fresh Design System
> repo. What components and icons can I use to build a dashboard screen?

The agent has access to all the docs, manifests, and component source code in the
repo, so it can make informed choices about which components to use and how to
compose them correctly.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to work without an AI agent, or want to understand the steps, follow
the manual path below.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v22 or later) — download from https://nodejs.org
- **Git** — likely already installed on your Mac (`git --version` to check)
- **A code editor** — VS Code or Cursor recommended
- **A terminal** — the one built into your editor works fine

If any of these are unfamiliar, ask an engineer to help with the initial setup. It
takes 5 minutes.

### Quick Start (5 Steps)

#### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zarni-fresh/fresh-design-system-v2.git
cd fresh-design-system
npm install
```

#### 2. Create a branch for your prototype

```bash
git checkout -b prototype/your-feature-name
```

Name it something descriptive, like `prototype/patient-intake-flow` or
`prototype/dashboard-redesign`.

#### 3. Open the blank starter

Open `apps/starter/App.tsx` in your editor. This is your canvas. It comes
pre-wired with a PageHeader, Card, TextField, and Button to show you the pattern.

#### 4. Run it

```bash
npm run dev:starter:web
```

This opens a browser preview. Changes you save in `App.tsx` appear immediately.

To preview on mobile instead:

```bash
npm run dev:starter
```

#### 5. Build your screens

Edit `App.tsx` to compose your prototype. Use the components listed below. When
you are done, commit and push your branch:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Prototype: patient intake flow"
git push origin prototype/your-feature-name
```

Share the branch name with the engineering team. They can pull it, run it, inspect
every component and layout decision, and translate it into production code.

## What Components Can I Use?

### Primitives (`@fresh-ds/ui-core`)

Basic building blocks for layout and text.

- `Stack` — arrange things vertically or horizontally with consistent gaps
- `Text` — all text on screen (supports size, weight, tone)
- `Box` — generic container when Stack doesn't fit
- `Icon` — 37 registered icons (see `docs/icons.md` for the full list)

### Components (`@fresh-ds/ui`)

The main UI elements.

- `Button` — actions (primary, secondary, outline, ghost, destructive)
- `TextField` — text inputs with labels and validation
- `Card` — grouped content surfaces
- `Badge` — status labels and tags
- `Avatar` — profile pictures with initials fallback
- `Label` — form field labels
- `Switch` — on/off toggles
- `Progress` — completion bars
- `Separator` — dividers between sections
- `Skeleton` — loading placeholders

### Recipes (`@fresh-ds/recipes`)

Higher-level screen blocks that combine multiple components.

- `PageHeader` — screen title with back button, badges, and actions
- `SectionHeader` — section title with optional action
- `SelectionCard` — tappable option card for selection screens
- `SummaryCard` — read-only summary with key-value rows
- `StickyActionFooter` — fixed bottom bar with primary/secondary actions

### Common Patterns

See `docs/screen-patterns.md` for 4 ready-made screen templates you can copy and
modify:

1. **Form Screen** — data entry with labeled inputs
2. **Selection Screen** — pick from a list of options
3. **Detail Screen** — read-only view of structured data
4. **Dashboard Screen** — KPIs and grouped content sections

## Where Do I Find the Available Icons?

See `docs/icons.md` for the full catalog of 37 icons. Common ones:

`plus`, `edit`, `trash`, `search`, `check`, `x`, `chevron-right`, `arrow-left`,
`user`, `settings`, `home`, `mail`, `phone`, `filter`, `eye`, `eye-off`, `menu`,
`more-vertical`, `info`, `heart`, `star`

Usage in your code:

```tsx
import { Icon } from '@fresh-ds/ui-core';

<Icon icon="plus" size={16} />
<Icon icon="search" size={16} tone="muted" />
```

## Two Ways to Prototype

We evaluated two approaches and recommend Option A for most prototyping work.

### Option A: Work in this repo (recommended)

Clone the Fresh Design System repo and build your prototype in `apps/starter`.

**Pros:**

- Zero config — tokens, components, recipes, dark mode, and NativeWind are all
  pre-wired and ready to go
- Engineers review your branch in the same repo — no cross-repo setup
- All documentation, manifests, and component rules are right at hand
- Multiple prototypes are just multiple branches

**Cons:**

- You are working inside a shared repo, so keep your changes in your branch
- The blank starter is a single `App.tsx` — for very large prototypes you may want
  to split into multiple files (ask an engineer if unsure)

**Best for:** Most prototyping work. Quick explorations, screen designs, workflow
simulations, and handoff to engineering.

### Option B: Your own repo with npm install

Create a standalone Expo project and install the Fresh packages:

```bash
npx create-expo-app my-prototype
cd my-prototype
npm install @fresh-ds/tokens @fresh-ds/ui-core @fresh-ds/ui @fresh-ds/recipes
```

You will need to configure the theme provider, NativeWind, and metro config
yourself. See the blank starter files for reference.

**Pros:**

- Fully independent — your own repo, your own pace
- Good foundation if the prototype will eventually become a real product app
- No risk of accidentally affecting the shared design system

**Cons:**

- More setup required (theme provider, NativeWind config, metro config)
- Engineers need access to a separate repo to review your work
- You are responsible for keeping packages updated (`npm update @fresh-ds/ui`)

**Best for:** Standalone apps that will live beyond the prototype phase, or teams
that need full independence from the design system repo.

## Tips

- **Start from screen patterns.** Copy a pattern from `docs/screen-patterns.md` and
  modify it rather than building from scratch.
- **Use recipes first.** `PageHeader` and `StickyActionFooter` handle the most
  common screen structure. Reach for individual components only when recipes don't
  cover your need.
- **Don't worry about pixel perfection.** The components enforce the right spacing,
  radius, and typography automatically. Focus on the flow and content.
- **Dark mode works automatically.** Toggle your system theme to see it.
- **Commit often.** Small commits with descriptive messages make it easier for
  engineers to follow your intent.
- **Ask for help.** If you are stuck on layout or can't find a component, ask in
  the team channel. The component status table (`docs/component-status.md`) shows
  what exists today.
